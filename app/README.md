## Overview

This is an app that allows users to check their typing speed by setting time in seconds and seeing how many words they can type in the textarea within the selected time period.

## My process

### Built with

- React.JS
By building this, I tested my knowledge of basic react topics like useState, useEffect, and React Forms and advanced topics like useRef

### Continued development
I planned to make this application a full-stack app where it can allow users to store their information and also store their different word counts for a particular time. This will help measure a player's typing speed improvement.
